Our first 4 tests in the DatesTest are written for for assignment 3.1, in the comments below the test we show what values
the Dates.class file returned. Afterwards we changed the tests to be applied to the DatesImproved class.

All local variables inside Dates.main, using jdb
someMonth = 1
someDay = 2
laterMonth = 3
laterDay = 4
someDayInYear = 31
laterDayInYear = 62
aMonth = 3
dayBetween = 33

The hidden method is located on line 12 and is called daysInMonth.
We enter the method on line 13 but the first line of the method is the head at line 12.

Line 13 - daysInMonth method returns the wrong values

Line 23 to 27 - Input accepts negative values

Line 34 - aMonth get assigned to 0. This feels weird and
feels like it might cause a bug, cause there is no month 0.

Line 47 to 48 - The variable daysBetween is calculated using faulty logic.
